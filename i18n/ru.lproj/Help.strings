FlashCards++ syncs your flash cards and sync data between your different iOS devices, like your iPhone and iPad, based off the initial upload of your flash card database, which you upload when you first set up the sync function.

Changes that you make, by editing cards or studying for example, are uploaded to the web server and shared with your other devices. However, over time, the initial upload becomes more and more out of date with the most recent versions of your data, and more and more of your current data is stored in the change sets. This slows down the sync function.

To best maintain the sync functionality and also to create a backup, it is recommended that you upload a new copy of your database every so often.

**What are the benefits?**

Subscribers have access to all FlashCards++ features and can have an unlimited number of cards. These features include text-to-speech audio, recording your own audio for flash cards, and keep your flash cards automatically synced between different iOS devices such as iPad and iPhone.

In addition, you're supporting the ongoing and future feature development of FlashCards++.

**How much does it cost?**

$3 for 3 months, so it's only $1 per month.

If FlashCards++ is worth that to you, I'd be grateful to have your support as a Subscriber.

**Why sell Subscriptions?**

FlashCards++ isn't the product of a huge company. It's a one-man shop: I am the one and only developer, designer, and handle all customer support. Thankfully there are many, many people who have found FlashCards++ helpful, but for this reason there are some features that I want to build that are unfortunately too complex or expensive to operate for all users so I've needed to limit them or omit them entirely. With Subscriptions, I can offer features that were previously impractical.

Subscriptions also build sustainable income to help ensure FlashCards++'s continued operation and future development.

**Do I need to buy a Subscription?**

No, but you will not have access to the majority of the FlashCards++ features. Especially if you want to support future development, I would appreciate your support.";

"Studying Chemistry ANSWER" =
"You can create chemistry math cards with superscripts and subscripts using the LaTeX formatting options. Please see 'Studying Math' for instructions on how to use the special formatting for math and chemistry.";

"Studying Math ANSWER" = "
Studying math with FlashCards++ is easy! You can now enter math equations (also useful for chemistry) using LaTeX or MathML (Math Markup Language). Here's how:

1. Go to the Collection (top level group) for your math flash cards, and tap 'Edit.' You will see options for the 'Language' of the front & back sides of the cards. Select 'Math' as the language for the side of the card that will have math.
2. Type in math equations using the proper markup language in the side of the card that you selected would include math equations.

How does it work? Here is an example of LaTeX and how it turns into a math equation:

*^3/_7* becomes: $ ^3/_7 $

... or something more complicated:

*a^2 = \\frac{b^2 - c^2}{3}* becomes $ a^2 = \\frac{b^2 - c^2}{3} $

[You can read a short tutorial on using LaTeX at Wikimedia which explains in more detail how to lay out math.](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) But here are some quick pointers:

1. Encapsulate your math around \"\$\" and \"\$\" so the app knows it's math.
2. Many of your basic math annotations will work. E.g. a ^ is an exponent. ! is !.
3. You can display some very complex math, and it will look really nice. This includes fractions, square roots, equations, calculus (derivatives and limits), sums, probabilities, and more.
4. Two of the most important elements are the carat (^) and underscore (_). Carats indicate things that go up (exponents, upper limits in integrals, etc.) and also the numerator in a fraction. Underscores (_) indicate things that go down: subscript, denomintators in fractions, etc.

I generally believe in learning by example. So here are some examples of common math problems that you might want to put into a flash card:

**Fractions**

There are 3 main ways to do fractions:

1. For simple fractions, you can use a short notation of a carat (^) followed by the numerator, then forwardslash (/), then an underscore (_), then the denomintator:

*^a/_b* becomes $ ^a/_b $

2. More complicated: Use a curly bracket followed by the numerator, then *\\over*, then the denomintator, then a final curly bracket.

*{n! \\over k!(n-k)!}* becomes $ {n! \\over k!(n-k)!} $

3. Or, begin with *\\frac* and then two sections *{a}* and *{b}*, like this: *\\frac{a}{b}*. The first item in curly-braces will go on top, the second on the bottom.

*\\frac{a^2}{b}* becomes $ \\frac{a^2}{b} $

**Square Roots**

Begin with \\sqrt. An optional [a] gives the power, and then {a} gives what goes under the root.

*\\sqrt{9} = 3* becomes $ \\sqrt{9} = 3 $

*\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3* becomes $ \\sqrt[3]{27} $

**Sums**

*\\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i* becomes $ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i $

**Calculus**

*\\int y: \\mathrm{d}x^2* becomes $ \\int y: \\mathrm{d}x^2 $

*\\int\\limits_b^a* becomes $ \\int\\limits_b^a $

**Special Characters**

These are only some of the special characters you can use:

*<* and *>* $ \\to < and > $
*\\leq* $ \\to \\leq $
*\\pm*  $ \\to \\pm $
*\\times* and *\\div* $ \\to \\times and \\div $
*\\alpha* $ \\to \\alpha $
*\\beta* $ \\to \\beta $
*\\delta* $ \\to \\delta $
*\\pi* $ \\to \\pi $ (and more or less all the other Greek letters)
*\\infty* $ \\to \\infty $
*\\implies* $ \\to \\implies $
*\\iff* $ \\to \\iff $
*\\forall* $ \\to \\forall $

If you read the tutorial on Wikimedia you\'ll learn more about how the math can be laid out. This will give you a taste for what can be done, if you want to make math flash cards that look great.

Then get to work! Read below for detaileds about [FlashCard++'s philosophy](#philosophy), [creating a collection](#collection), [importing cards](#import), [studying](#studying), [making sense of the statistics](#stats), and a [glossary](#glossary).

**<a name=\"philosophy\"></a>The FlashCards++ Philosophy: Creating Your Database of Knowledge**

With FlashCards++, you create a \"database of knowledge\" about a subject (such as foreign vocabulary) and establish a study regiment to learn and retain as much as possible. To accomplish this, you create a \"Collection\" of flash cards and study them at optimal intervals using the Spaced Repetition System, based on the pioneering SuperMemo.

Information should not be duplicated. If you have two identical cards, the cards should be \"merged\" so you only have one copy. Otherwise you will spend twice as much time studying two cards!

After creating many cards you will have an invaluable tool--a database of your knowledge that will enable you to study it over time so that you can develop long-term memory and gain mastery of the subject.

**<a name=\"\"></a>The FlashCards++ Method: Spaced Repetition**

FlashCards++ has one goal: enable you to study vast amounts of material with minimal amount of time investment, *and still maintain good memory retention!* This goal is achieved through the Spaced Repetition System, a studying model to approximate the amount of time between when you learn something and when you will forget it.

The \"optimal interval\" is calculated by assigning each card an \"E-Factor\" between 1.2 and 2.5, which represents how easy or difficult it is. FlashCards++ uses this data to estimate how long you should wait between your current study session and the next time you should study.

**<a name=\"collection\"></a>Creating a Collection**

The first step is to create a \"Collection\" to house your database of knowledge. You can have as many collections as you want, you should separate them based on content, e.g. you may have one collection for Russian vocabulary, one for Chinese, another one for math. Simply tap the \"+\" on the home screen. If it is a language, turn on \"Language Tools\" which auto-adjust E-Factors based on word length and other variables.

**<a name=\"import\"></a>Importing Cards**

You can import cards from [Quizlet](http://www.quizlet.com/), one of the most popular flash card sites. You can also import from Excel and CSV files via Dropbox. Here's how:

 1. Enter cards into a two-column spreadsheet, with column A as the front side and column B as the back side. If you have images, you can import them via CSV or Excel by uploading the images to a website and putting the URL for the image for the front side in column C, and the URL for the image on the back side in column D. Upload the cards to Quizlet or Dropbox.    On Quizlet, choose \"bulk-import cards\" and then paste your spreadsheet into the text field.
 2. Go back to FlashCards++, and go to your collection. Then, click \"Import Cards,\" where you will have options to import from Quizlet, or Dropbox:
     a. **To import from Quizlet:** you can browse a list of your personal card sets, or browse/search through the Quizlet database. Click on a card set to view its contents and download it.
     b. **To import from Dropbox:** navigate your Dropbox to where the file can be found, and select your CSV or Excel file.
 3. If any of the cards already exist in your collection, you will be prompted to \"merge\" them. If you choose to merge the cards, you can select which version of the front or back sides to keep from the new vs. the old card. If you choose not to merge them, you can mark them as \"related,\" which will show them together while you study. Click \"Next &gt;\" until you have processed all the duplicates. Then click \"Save\" again.
 4. You will next be prompted to edit the new cards. This is a great way to begin studying because you will sequence through the cards and you can also look for any typos you may find. For collections with Language Tools, you can also mark words as cognates or \"false friends.\"
 
**<a name=\"study\"></a>Studying Cards**

After importing a set of cards, you can get started studying. There are four study modes:

 - **Learn Cards** lets you study all cards or a random set of 30. There are three main methods, linear, random, and \"smart study,\" which will show you a card more or less often based on its difficulty and your responses. At the end of each round of studying in **Learn** mode you will be prompted to begin testing; shift to this mode when you feel ready.
 - **Test Cards** sends you straight to test the cards.
 - **Review (Spaced Repetition)** forces you to study cards which you are ready to study based on the optimal interval.
 - **Study Lapsed Cards** allows you to study cards which are \"lapsed\"--i.e. you memorized them and tested them, but when it came time to review them you failed the test. This is a quick way to re-learn cards and re-insert them into the Spaced Repetition system.
 
The suggested study method is to (1) import cards, (2) study using Smart Study method, and then (3) test. Then (4) review cards when they arise, (5) study cards which scored less than 4 (to review them), and then (6) study lapsed cards when you have a decent number to review.

Remember: **swipe right-to-left** goes to the next card; **swipe left-to-right** goes to the previous card; and **tap** flips the card.

*NB: Lock your device when you are not studying to improve the accuracy of the study time statistics, which help determine which cards are easier or more difficult. While your device is locked, the timer is paused.

When studying cards you can give five different types of responses: Fail (cannot remember at all); Almost (cannot remember, but it feels familiar); Barely (can recall, but with great difficulty); OK (can recall but no more than slight hesitation); and Easy (can recall with absolutely no hesitation). You can also choose not to grade your card.

**<a name=\"stats\"></a>Making Sense of Statistics**

FlashCards++ gives you access to a great many statistics; here is a quick rundown of the most important:

 - **Cards Due By Day**: How many cards you will have to study in the future based on the Spaced Repetition schedule.
 - **Cards Studied (by day, week, or month)**: A graph of how many cards you actually studied on particular days, weeks, or months.
 - **Retention Rate**: An estimation of how well you are retaining information based on how you score on Spaced Repetition review tests.
 - **Total Repetition Time**: The total amount of time you have spent studying the information in repetitions.
 - **Workload**: An estimation of the average amount of time per day you will spend per day studying the material, based upon the statistics
 - **E-Factors**: A chart showing you the distribution of the E-Factors for cards in the card set or collection.
 - **Optimal Factors (OF-Matrix)**: A chart showing you the current adjusted OF-Matrix based on your learning style. You can to reset the OF-Matrix to factory settings if you want.

 - **Card**: A discrete piece of information, with a front and back \"side\" (a \"question\" and \"answer\").
 - **Collection**: A group of cards, constituting a body of knowledge.
 - **Card Set**: A group of cards, grouped into a set. Because FlashCards++ \"auto de-dupes\" your cards as you import them, sometimes a card may be in multiple Card Sets due to merging.
 - **E-Factor:** A mathematical coefficient to represent how easy or difficult a card is. Ranges between 1.2 to 2.5. A higher E-Factor represents an easier card.
 - **Optimal Interval**: The calculated \"optimal\" time between when you study a card, and the time when FlashCards++ next prompts you to study it. This interval is based upon the card's E-Factor--easier cards are studied less often than difficult cards--and the matrix of Optimal Factors (OF-Matrix).
 - **Optimal Factor (OF) Matrix**: A mathematical construct which attempts to best calculate when you should study cards based on their difficulty and the particular study interval at which you have arrived. This matrix is auto-adjusted to match your learning habits and specifically whether certain \"optimal\" intervals were too long (i.e. you forgot the card) or too short (the card could have been studied later, making your studying more efficient).";
